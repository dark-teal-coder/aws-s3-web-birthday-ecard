# Description 
This repository contains SAS code and results from some tutorials on [SAS Video Tutorials](https://video.sas.com/). It is divided into sub-directories by tutorial. Within each tutorial, there will be at least one SAS code file and one .pdf output file printed from its .html results file. There are 3 options to download the results generated from the SAS code - an HTML file, a PDF file and an RTF file. Since only the HTML file option is available, it was downloaded and converted to a .pdf file (by printing) instead. Save the HTML file as PDF by the following format: 
- Layout: Landscape
- Paper size: A4
- Margins: Default
- Scale: Default
- Options: 
    - [ ] Headers and footers 
    - [x] Background graphics

SAS provides a free browser-based programming interface called [SAS OnDemand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html) to write and run SAS code. Account registration is needed to use this service. It may take a short while before you gain the access to the online platform.
