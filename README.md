# AWS S3 Website Responsive Birthday E-card

## Repository Description

I came up with an idea to make this birthday e-card as a respoonsive website hosted on AWS S3 for a friend on her birthday on Apr 18, 2024. Given how busy my life was, I'd only make this simple webiste during my lunchtime on the day. I'd finish the entire website from scratch simply using the simple rule of "google, copy and modify code". I googled in the format of "how to...", e.g., "how to make a 2-column layout", took a glance at the resultsl, selected the best solutions, copied and modified the code. After finishing the 1st version, the website looked unresponsive to different screen sizes. Hence, I did a quick search on how to make a website responsive and just copied the code and ran it to see the results. After I got the intended results, I looked up the steps to host a static website on AWS S3. That's it! 

AWS S3 only supported HTTP at the time of creation. If you access the site via the HTTP link and your internet browser asks to confirm if you trust this (unsecure) webiste, just say "yes". I didn't put a virus there, promise. If I knew how, I'd be earning lots of money (illegally) and wouldn't try to create open-source projects. Some internet browsers like Chrome will try to automatically change HTTP to HTTPS. Users have to change the link back to HTTP or they will not be able to view the site. 

As this is a responsive website, try to rotate your phone screen to both portrait and landsape. Or, if you're on a computer, change the screen size from minimized to full and from full to half. Play around! 

I'm not a web developer. Any constructive feedback from professionals is welcomed and appreciated.
