# AWS S3 Birthday E-card as Responsive Static Website

I came up with an idea to make this birthday e-card as a respoonsive website hosted on AWS S3 for a friend on her birthday on Apr 18, 2024. Given how busy my life was, I'd only make this simple webiste during my lunchtime on the day. I'd finish the entire website from scratch simply using the simple rule of "google, copy and modify code". I googled in the format of "how to...", e.g., "how to make a 2-column layout", took a glance at the resultsl, selected the best solutions, copied and modified the code. After finishing the 1st version, the website looked unresponsive to different screen sizes. Hence, I did a quick search on how to make a website responsive and just copied the code and ran it to see the results. After I got the intended results, I looked up the steps to host a static website on AWS S3. That's it!   

AWS S3 only supported HTTP at the time of creation. Some browser like Chrome will try to automatically change HTTP to HTTPS. Users have to change the link back to HTTP or they will not be able to view the site.
